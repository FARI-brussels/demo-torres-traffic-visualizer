# Traffic visualizer using sumo and cesium

This repo host different piece of code that allow to translate the output of a sumo trafic simulation to a 3D simulation using cesium.

This is part of the work of Helin Demirel, intern from ULB computer sciences

The plan was to also include real-time simulation using the [real time data from bruxelles mobilit√©](https://data.mobility.brussels/fr/info/traffic_live_geom/)
However the student did not reach that objective. 

I would like to reiterate on that demo at some point.
